- A real katana weight is around 1.1â€“1.5 kg. This mod makes it 1.5 kg. instead of 2.
- A real katana blade length is around 80cm. This mod slightly increase from 0.4 to 0.5 tile and increase reach from 1.4 to 1.5 tiles.
- Really, it shouldn't break so easily. The max condition is adjusted to 100 instead of 10.
- Lower chance to decrease katana's condition
- Allow attaching a katana on a belt
