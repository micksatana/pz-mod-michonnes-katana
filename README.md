Project Zomboid mod - Michonne's Katana

## Features

According to actual katana facts, this mod adds Michonne's Katana based on the following stats

- A real katana weight is around 1.1–1.5 kg. This mod makes it 1.5 kg. instead of 2.
- A real katana blade length is around 80cm. This mod slightly increase from 0.4 to 0.5 tile and increase reach from 1.4 to 1.5 tiles.
- Really, it shouldn't break so easily. The max condition is adjusted to 100 instead of 10.
- Lower chance to decrease katana's condition
- Allow attaching a katana on a belt
- Critical chance and damage is significantly increased.
- Built-in Michonne's Katana Sheath

This mod preserves the Base Katana stats. The changes above are only applied to Michonne's Katana.

## FAQ

- Why attaching the first time, the sheath not showing? Due to limitation of Events API, we can only check when equipping it. So the first time attaching the katana, we can't render the sheath.
